    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Processing**\n",
    "   - Users submit natural language questions (e.g., \"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?\")\n",
    "   - The system converts these questions into vector embeddings using the same embedding model used for document processing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Indexing Pipeline**\n",
    "   - PDF documents are loaded and parsed into plain text or markdown format\n",
    "   - Text is divided into semantically meaningful chunks for more precise retrieval\n",
    "   - Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning\n",
    "   - These embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieval System**\n",
    "   - The system performs semantic search using the query embedding\n",
    "   - Top-K most relevant chunks are identified and ranked by similarity score\n",
    "   - Retrieved chunks contain contextually relevant information (e.g., definitions of supervised vs. unsupervised learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context Augmentation**\n",
    "   - The original user question is combined with retrieved text chunks\n",
    "   - A structured prompt is created that instructs the LLM how to use the retrieved information\n",
    "   - The system organizes the context to facilitate accurate answer generation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Generation**\n",
    "   - The LLM processes the augmented context and generates a comprehensive answer\n",
    "   - The response is grounded in the retrieved document content rather than potentially outdated training data\n",
    "   - The final answer is presented to the user in a clear, readable format\n"

       "> \n",
       "> Here's how it uses self-attention for this purpose:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 1.  **Core Mechanism:** Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism designed to relate different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. Unlike traditional recurrent networks, which process symbols sequentially, self-attention allows the model to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 2.  **Dependency Capture Regardless of Distance:** A key advantage of self-attention is its ability to model dependencies between positions \"without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences.\" In other models like ConvS2S or ByteNet, the number of operations required to relate distant positions grows with their distance, making it harder to learn long-range dependencies. In the Transformer, this is reduced to a constant number of operations.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 3.  **Multi-Head Attention:** To counteract the reduced effective resolution that can occur from averaging attention-weighted positions, the Transformer employs Multi-Head Attention. This mechanism allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, enhancing its ability to capture complex dependencies.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 4.  **Architectural Integration:**\n",
       ">     *   The Transformer follows an encoder-decoder architecture, where both components extensively use self-attention.\n",
       ">     *   **Encoder:** Each layer of the encoder stack contains a multi-head self-attention mechanism.\n",
       ">     *   **Decoder:** Each layer of the decoder stack also includes a multi-head self-attention mechanism (modified to prevent attending to subsequent positions) and an additional multi-head attention sub-layer that attends over the output of the encoder stack.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> 5.  **Parallelization and Path Length:** By relying entirely on self-attention, the Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization during training, as it removes the fundamental constraint of sequential computation present in RNNs. Furthermore, self-attention reduces the path length between any combination of positions in the input and output, which is critical for learning long-range dependencies efficiently.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> In essence, the Transformer uses stacked multi-head self-attention layers to directly relate all positions within a sequence, allowing it to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when processing each part, thereby capturing dependencies across arbitrary distances in a highly parallelizable manner."
